This is an animation game about a smart factory where different types of robots work in coordination to produce new robots, some of which also join them to speed up the production.
When building , I employed the object-oriented design principles. I applied Factory and Abstract Factory patterns together with threading primitives: synchronized, wait, notify, notifyAll.
I also implemented reflection for accessing/modifying private attributes of a class. Details are provided in description [pdf](https://github.com/ftasbasi/Object-Oriented-Programming/blob/main/Industry%204.0/Industry%204.0%20Description.pdf).
