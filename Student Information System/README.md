This is a student information system (SIS). Once the system processes studentsâ€™ optical forms, it will be ready for responding to various queries about the students. When building the system, I employed the object-oriented design principles in this project. Furthermore, I employed Java 8 Streams to respond to the queries efficiently. Details are provided in description [pdf](https://github.com/ftasbasi/Object-Oriented-Programming/blob/main/Student%20Information%20System/SIS%20Description.pdf).
