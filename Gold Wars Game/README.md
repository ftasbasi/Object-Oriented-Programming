This is an animation game about countries buying/selling gold and intelligence agencies intercepting countriesâ€™ buy/sell orders. When building the animation, I employed the object-oriented design principles.
I applied Factory and Abstract Factory patterns. Countries do not know what type of order they have generated.
I applied Decorator pattern. The IA is not be aware of the fact that it is being decorated by other parts of the application.
